# Dynamic Array Implementation

Simple dynamic array implementation in C by Raeid.

This is a simple exercise I completed in preparation for my [CS 136](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/current/) exam at uWaterloo. 

## Features
- Opaque data structure
- User is responsible for managing memory
- Dynamic Arrays are self-optimizing
- Makes use of [`lumber.h`](https://github.com/Raeid-U/lumber), another project by Raeid-U for logging in C
